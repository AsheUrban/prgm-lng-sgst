<!-- We are going to talk through this! I need to build a form that helps people decide which programming language to learn. I will ask a total of 5 questions and offer one of three programming languages as a suggested path. They will have the choice to choose from Ruby, C#, or JavaScript. My 5 questions will be:
1. age (text)
2. preferred hobby: trail running, skiing, or painting. (radio buttons)
3. Whether they prefer toast or cereal in the morning. (text)
4. They look more like their mom. (range input)
5. Name


If age <=20, prefer painting, cereal, look more like their mom = Ruby
If age >=20, prefer trail running, toast, and look medium like their mom = JavaScript
If age  50, prefer skiing, cereal, and look less like their mom = C#
